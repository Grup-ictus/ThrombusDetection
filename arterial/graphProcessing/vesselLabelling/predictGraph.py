def predictGraph(caseDir):
    ''' Inputs the graph derived from the segmentsArray in edge form (edges as centerline segments), 
    passes it to node form, performs the prediction by inference with the graph U-Net
    model and returns the original graph in edge form with the predicted vessel types
